# Information Warfare Simulator (IWS) - Real-Time Cognitive Warfare & Red-Teaming Platform

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/infowar.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

IWS (Information Warfare Simulator) is an advanced, indigenous cognitive warfare training and simulation system designed to train defense personnel, intelligence officers, and strategic commanders. Driven by complex demographic algorithms and fuzzy logic, it empowers users to simulate and counter coordinated disinformation campaigns, deepfakes, and narrative manipulation across interconnected geographic regions in real-time.

A key highlight of IWS is its dual-sided red-teaming architecture. Officers can simultaneously roleplay as offensive threat actors (Hostile Disinfo Cells) and defensive mitigation teams (Defense Strategy). This capability allows for precise training in identifying, tracking, and neutralizing cognitive threats before they result in widespread panic or the erosion of public trust in military objectives.

With its robust GIS (Geographic Information System) integration, zero external dependencies, and dynamic After-Action Reporting, IWS provides a seamless way to execute high-stakes wargaming scenarios, reinforcing its role as a pivotal tool in modern cognitive domain dominance.


## Key Features of IWS

#### 1. Immersive GIS Command Center
- Monitor unfolding operations on a live, interactive geographic map.
- Track real-time metric shifts including Population Belief Rates, Panic Levels, and Trust Erosion across 60+ localized demographic variables.

#### 2. Dual-Sided Red Teaming Operations
- **Offensive Playbook:** Deploy highly tailored disinformation (Text Posts, Deepfakes, Fabricated Quotes, Coordinated Campaigns) with tunable Emotional Charge and Credibility Scores.
- **Defensive Playbook:** Utilize AI-assisted capability to run Deep Scans, conduct Reconnaissance, Takedown malicious content, and issue Fact-Check Broadcasts to mitigate panic.

#### 3. Advanced Fuzzy Logic & Disinformation Fatigue
- Built-in AI-driven fuzzy logic simulates population resilience dynamically.
- Populations build "Disinformation Fatigue" over time as exposure increases, naturally dampening the spread of spam-like attacks using non-linear sigmoid learning curves.

#### 4. Zero-Dependency & Air-Gapped Superiority
- 100% self-contained web architecture that operates entirely off-grid.
- No reliance on foreign APIs, ensuring complete data sovereignty and seamless deployment in highly classified, isolated military intranets.

#### 5. Automated After-Action Reporting (AAR)
- Fully automated debriefs generated at the end of every simulation.
- Replay the timeline of injected events, track the reach of mitigated vs. unmitigated threats, and analyze final vulnerability scores at both regional and national levels.

#### 6. Scalable & Dockerized Deployment
- Complete one-command Docker installation.
- Supports 100+ concurrent operational training staff on standard commodity hardware (4-core CPU, 8GB RAM).

This feature set showcases the power of IWS as a highly efficient and hyper-realistic cognitive wargaming environment designed specifically for the strategic defense sector.

## Interactive Walkthrough Demo

Below is an interactive video walkthrough demonstrating the platform's multi-perspective capabilities, transitioning between the God-View Command Center, the Attacker's Dashboard, the Defender's Terminal, and the Final AAR.

## Operational Scenarios
IWS is pre-loaded with customizable operations, including the flagship **"Operation Sentinel"**—a specialized urban terror response scenario highlighting the immediate tactical needs of defending critical information infrastructure while kinetic operations are underway.
