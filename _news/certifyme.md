## üèÜ CertifyMe: Our Official Certification Partner

Our new partnership establishes **CertifyMe** as the exclusive Digital Certification Partner for **all Creative Net events, workshops, and courses** for the next year.

This strategic move is designed to benefit our community by addressing a critical industry need: trust and verifiability.

**What This Partnership Means for Our Programs:**

- **Verifiable Credibility:** Every eligible participant in a Creative Net program will receive a secure, globally verifiable digital credential issued through the CertifyMe platform. This makes our certificates tamper-proof and instantly verifiable by employers on professional networks like LinkedIn.
- **Career Asset:** We are transforming the course certificate from a simple document into a valuable, portable career asset that truly represents acquired skills.

## First Initiative: The Python Level Up Course

The launch of our enhanced **Python Level Up** course is the first program to operate under this new, high-value agreement:

- **Certification:** Final certificates for this course will be sponsored by CertifyMe.
- **Commitment:** To ensure we deliver on our end of the partnership, **Python Level Up** participants will need to complete a G2 review for CertifyMe within a specified post-course window to claim their credential. This is a vital step that reinforces the integrity and value of the certification itself.

**Creative Net** is dedicated to ensuring our students leave with skills and professional recognition that opens doors. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with CertifyMe.
