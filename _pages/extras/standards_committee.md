## Standards Committee/ WG we are part of and contributing to

Creative Net is a member of the following standards organizations and working groups:

### IEEE SA WG - P3120 [Standard for Quantum Computing Architecture]

This standard defines a technical architecture for quantum computers. Features and characteristics of the architecture are based on quantum qubit modalities (e.g., superconducting, neutral atoms, trapped ions, photonic, NV centers), and mode of operations (e.g., digital and analog). The defined architectures include the hardware (e.g., signal generator), low-level software (e.g., quantum error correction) components, and programming method (description of quantum circuits, description of Hamiltonian evolution) of such architectures.

### IEEE SA WG - P3348 [Recommended Practice for the Framework and Evaluation Methods of Two-Dimensional (2D) Real-Person Digital Clothes Model Generation System Based on Artificial Intelligence]

This standard defines a framework including requirements and evaluation methods for a two-dimensional (2D) real-person digital clothes model generation system using artificial intelligence (AI). In the standard, the framework includes functional modules and the input/output interfaces of the 2D real-person digital clothes model generation system. The input interface includes pictures of the clothes to be presented, clothes measurements, and model types. The output interface provides a mechanism to export images of the generated models in clothes and multiple postures. The framework includes modules for digital model face generation, clothes generation, digital model posture generation, and image fusion. Methods for evaluating the generated 2D real-person digital clothes models are also specified in this standard.
