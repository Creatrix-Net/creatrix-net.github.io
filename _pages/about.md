**I, [Dhruva Shaw](https://dhruvashaw.in "Personal Portfolio"), have launched Creative नेट (Creative Net) to bring all my projects together under a single umbrella.** In the past, I've initiated various projects like [Minato Namikaze](https://minatonamikaze.dhruvashaw.in/ "Minato Namikaze Discord Bot"), [ShawDurgaPuja](https://github.com/Dhruvacube/shawdurgapuja "Github Repo of shawdurgapuja website"), and [fluxpoint.py](https://fluxpointpy.readthedocs.io/ "fluxpoint.py pakage"), but unfortunately, they eventually stalled due to the lack of a centralized organization.

**Creative नेट aims to revive these exciting projects and propel them forward.** Our core focus is on generating research in robotics and automation, while also developing practical solutions (both hardware and software) to advance the field of robotics.
