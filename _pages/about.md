<b>Creative Net</b> is an indigenous, agile Deep Tech R&D entity founded by <b>Dhruva Shaw</b> to consolidate advanced engineering innovations under a centralized strategic framework.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Originally initiated to incubate experimental projects like <a href="https://minatonamikaze.thecreativenet.in" target="_blank">Minato Namikaze</a> and <a href="https://fluxpointpy.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">fluxpoint.py</a>, Creative Net has evolved into a Udyam-registered MSME (Government of India) dedicated to solving critical problem statements for National Security and Enterprise Automation.

<b>Our Mission:</b>
To function as a competency-based task force that bridges the gap between academic innovation and defense-grade deployment.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Core Domains:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Multi-Domain Intelligence:</b> Advanced OSINT, SIGINT, and GEOINT systems for Digital Identity Verification and Threat Anticipation (featuring our flagship platform, <b>Adverse</b>).</li>
<li><b>Robotics & Unmanned Systems:</b> Hardware-software integration for autonomous operations.</li>
<li><b>Cybersecurity:</b> Active defense mechanisms and digital surveillance.</li>
