## Cancellation Policy

Minato Namikaze offers a monthly subscription-based premium service.

- **Cancellation:** Subscribers can cancel their subscription at any time. However, the cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle. No refunds will be provided for unused portions of the current billing period.
- **Reactivation:** If you cancel your subscription, you can reactivate it at any time by subscribing again.

## Refund and Return Policy
