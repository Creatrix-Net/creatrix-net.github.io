title: Mind Controlled Bionic Arm with Sense of Touch
description: Imagine a prosthetic arm that functions like your natural arm. You wear a headband, and with the thought process, the working signal from mind connects to the prosthetic about moving the arm, it responds accordinglyâ€”just like your real arm!

# Abstract

Advancements in bionic technology are transforming the possibilities for restoring hand function in individuals with amputations or paralysis. This paper introduces a cost-effective bionic arm design that leverages mind-controlled functionality and integrates a sense of touch to replicate natural hand movements. The system utilizes a non-invasive EEG-based control mechanism, enabling users to operate the arm using brain signals processed into PWM commands for servo motor control of the bionic arm. Additionally, the design incorporates a touch sensor (tactile feedback) in the gripper, offering sensory feedback to enhance user safety and dexterity.
The proposed bionic arm prioritizes three essential features:
1. Integrated Sensory Feedback: Providing users with a tactile experience to mimic the sense of touch (signals directly going to the brain). This capability is crucial for safe object manipulation by arm and preventing injuries
2. Mind-Control Potential: Harnessing EEG signals for seamless, thought-driven operation.
3. Non-Invasive Nature: Ensuring user comfort by avoiding invasive surgical procedures.
This novel approach aims to deliver an intuitive, natural, and efficient solution for restoring complex hand functions.
