## Abstract

Advancements in bionic technology are transforming the possibilities for restoring hand function in individuals with amputations or paralysis. This paper introduces a **cost-effective bionic arm** design that leverages **mind-controlled functionality** and integrates a **sense of touch** to replicate natural hand movements. The system utilizes a **non-invasive EEG-based control mechanism**, enabling users to operate the arm using brain signals processed into PWM commands for servo motor control of the bionic arm. Additionally, the design incorporates a touch sensor (tactile feedback) in the gripper, offering sensory feedback to enhance user safety and dexterity<d-cite key="nprnews"></d-cite>.
The proposed bionic arm prioritizes three essential features:
1. **Integrated Sensory Feedback**: Providing users with a tactile experience to mimic the sense of touch (signals directly going to the brain). This capability is crucial for safe object manipulation by arm and preventing injuries
2. **Mind-Control Potential**: Harnessing EEG signals for seamless, thought-driven operation.
3. **Non-Invasive Nature**: Ensuring user comfort by avoiding invasive surgical procedures.
This novel approach aims to deliver an intuitive, natural, and efficient solution for restoring complex hand functions.

## Motivation and Journey
### 1. Our Journey: From SIH Hackathon to Independent Research
Our journey began at the internal hackathon of SIH 2023 at Lovely Professional University, held on September 27th and 28th. We had a thrilling 30 hours to tackle a challenging problem statement provided by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.

Initially, the problem statement focused on "Low Cost Mind Control Bionic Arm." However, it was later refined to "Low Cost Myoelectric Prosthetic Arm" with the new PS code "SIH1404."

{% details SIH1404 - Low Cost Myoelectric Prosthetic Arm %}

+ **ID**: SIH1404
+ **Title**: Low-cost Myoelectric Prosthetic Arm
+ **Technology Bucket**: MedTech / BioTech / HealthTech
+ **Category**: Hardware
+ **Description**: In India the cost of a new Myoelectric/Bionic prosthetic arm can range from 1lakh - 2 lakh Rupees, putting the Myoelectric hand out of reach of many middle-class and lower middle-class patients/amputee, we decided to design and build a far cheaper and pocket friendly version of prosthetic arm with Myoelectric capabilities. We are using 3-DPrinting technology for the structure of the prosthetic hand, and servo motors and Arduino for the mechanical purpose, Myoware muscle sensor is responsible for reading the electrical signals generated by muscle. These components and microprocessor can bring the cost of the prosthetic arm much cheaper and pocket friendly for the patient/amputee.
+ **Problem Creater's Organization**: Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment

{% enddetails %}

While we successfully navigated the internal hackathon, we unfortunately didn't make it to the regionals. But our passion for this project didn't diminish. We decided to continue our exploration as an independent research endeavor.

Throughout the internal SIH 2023 hackathon, we were fortunate to have the guidance of Dr. Bhaveshkumar C Dharmani, whose mentorship proved invaluable.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection and Dataset Overview
The model development utilized a publicly available EEG dataset comprising data from **60 volunteers** performing **8 distinct activities**<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite> . The dataset includes a total of **8,680 four-second EEG recordings**, collected using **16 dry electrodes** configured according to the **international 10-10 system**<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
* Electrode Configuration: Monopolar configuration, where each electrode's potential was measured relative to neutral electrodes placed on both earlobes (ground references).
* Signal Sampling: EEG signals were sampled at **125 Hz** and preprocessed using:
    - **A bandpass filter (5â€“50 Hz)** to isolate relevant frequencies<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
    - **A notch filter (60 Hz)** to remove powerline interference<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.

        </div>
    </div>
</div>

### 2. Data Preprocessing
The dataset, originally provided in **CSV format**, underwent a comprehensive preprocessing workflow:
* The data was split into individual CSV files for each of the 16 channels, resulting in an increase from **74,441** files to **1,191,056** files.
* Each individual channel's EEG data was converted into **audio signals** and saved in **.wav format**, allowing the brain signals to be audibly analyzed.
* The entire preprocessing workflow was implemented in **Python** to ensure scalability and accuracy.
The dataset captured brainwave signals corresponding to the following activities:
1. **BEO** (Baseline with Eyes Open): One-time recording at the beginning of each run<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
2. **CLH** (Closing Left Hand): Five recordings per run<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
3. **CRH** (Closing Right Hand): Five recordings per run<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
4. **DLF** (Dorsal Flexion of Left Foot): Five recordings per run<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
5. **PLF** (Plantar Flexion of Left Foot): Five recordings per run<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
6. **DRF** (Dorsal Flexion of Right Foot): Five recordings per run<d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
7. **PRF** (Plantar Flexion of Right Foot): Five recordings per <d-cite key="asanza2023"></d-cite>.
8. **Rest**: Recorded between each task to capture the resting <d-cite key="asanza2023, gigadb"></d-cite>.

### 3. Feature Extraction and Classification
Feature extraction and activity classification were performed using **transfer learning** with **YamNet** <d-cite key="yamnetgithub"></d-cite>, a deep neural network model.
* **Audio Representation**: Audio files were imported into **MATLAB** using an **Audio Datastore**<d-cite key="audiodatastore"></d-cite>. Mel-spectrograms, a time-frequency representation of the audio signals, were extracted using the yamnetPreprocess function<d-cite key="yamnetpreprocess, transferlearningmatlab"></d-cite>.
* Dataset Split: The data was divided into **training (70%)**, **validation (20%)**, and **testing (10%)** sets<d-cite key="transferlearningmatlab"></d-cite>.
Transfer Learning with YamNet :
- The **pre-trained YamNet model** (86 layers)<d-cite key="yamnetgithub"></d-cite> was adapted for an 8-class classification task:
    + The initial layers of YamNet were **frozen** to retain previously learned representations<d-cite key="transferlearningmatlab, yamnetgithub"></d-cite>.
    + A **new classification layer** was added to the model <d-cite key="transferlearningmatlab"></d-cite>.
- Training details:
    + **Learning Rate**: Initial rate of **3e-4**, with an exponential learning rate decay schedule<d-cite key="transferlearningmatlab"></d-cite>.
    + **Mini-Batch Size**: 128 samples per batch<d-cite key="transferlearningmatlab"></d-cite>.
    + **Validation**: Performed every **651 iterations**.

### 4. Robotic Arm Design and Simulation
A **3-Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) robotic arm** was designed using **MATLAB Simulink** and **Simscape toolboxes**. To ensure robust validation:
* A **virtual environment** was developed in Simulink, simulating the interactions between the trained AI models and the robotic arm.
* The simulations served as a testbed to evaluate the system's performance before real-world integration.

## Conclusion and Future Work
To enhance the accuracy and performance of our mind-controlled bionic arm with a sense of touch, we propose the following refinements, that we intend to do in future:

**Model Refinement**:
* **Feature Augmentation**: Incorporate additional features such as delta, theta, beta, alpha, and gamma wave components, along with signal processing metrics like SNR, bandwidth, mean frequency, occupied bandwidth, and standard deviation.
* **Ensemble Learning**: Train a separate AI classification model on these augmented features and combine its predictions with the YamNet model using a data fusion technique, similar to sensor fusion.

**Hardware Integration and User Experience**:
* **Hardware Optimization**: Further optimize the hardware implementation to ensure reliable and efficient operation.
* **Tactile Feedback Development**: Develop a sophisticated tactile feedback system to provide the user with a realistic sense of touch.

This project represents a significant step towards realizing a functional mind-controlled bionic arm with a sense of touch. However, substantial research and development efforts are still required to bring this technology to market.
